# Atrocity-as-Epistemic-Failure
This paper reconceptualises Nazi camp guards as epistemic subjects shaped by systemic betrayal, integrating classical psychology with Kahl’s Epistemic Clientelism Theory and fiduciary–epistemic duties. It redefines atrocity as epistemic failure and authority as fiduciary trusteeship, proposing safeguards for pluralism and atrocity prevention.
